# Facebook V: Predicting Check Ins

In a virtual city bounded by a 10 km by 10 km square consisting of over 100,000 places, predict a ranked list of the most likely places that a person is going to check in, if the set of coordinates and the timestamp is provided.

## Getting Started
To Run this project on local machine, have a good GPU and RAM, or have google colaboratory set up with your google account

### Prerequisites
 
Google Drive and Google Colaboratory set up.
If Running on local machine, then a python interpretor and a development environment such as Jupyter Notebook. 

### Languages Used

The entire project was done in python.


## Deployment

First setup a google drive and google colaboratory account if not already done.
Then, paste the training and testing files in a folder on the drive
Create a new colaboratory notebook and paste or load the project code in it. 
Execute each cell sequentially and observe the output obtained after each cell execution. 

##Output
Each cell execution will display the intermediate output of the project.
The outputs include the dataframe after adding the hyperparameters and preprocessing.
Execution of every classifier
Ranked list of the top three places.
and the evaluation metrics of the classifiers and results.
